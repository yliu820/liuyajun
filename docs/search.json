    "text": "Hi, I am final-year PhD student in Linguistics at the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, the University of Edinburgh. I am supervised by Professor Kenny Smith and Professor Antonella Sorace. I am also a member of Centre for Language Evolution. My research project focuses on the phenomenon of referential over-explicitness in the native language of late bilinguals undergoing first language attrition, specifically among speakers of L1 Chinese with L2 English and L1 Chinese with L2/L3 Italian or Spanish. I also explore the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon from both linguistic and cognitive perspectives. Additionally, I am interested in the role of communication in shaping languages over time within the bilingual communities."
