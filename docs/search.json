    "text": "Hi, I am a final-year (4th) PhD student in Linguistics at the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences (PPLS), the University of Edinburgh. I am supervised by Professor Kenny Smith and Professor Antonella Sorace. I am also a member of the Centre for Language Evolution. My research project focuses on how native speakers with varying language experiences detect and resolve referential ambiguity. I explore the underlying mechanisms of their linguistic choices from both linguistic and cognitive perspectives. More broadly, I am interested in the role of communication in shaping languages over time."
