    "text": "Hi, I am final-year PhD student in Linguistics at the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, the University of Edinburgh. I am supervised by Professor Kenny Smith and Professor Antonella Sorace. I am also a member of Centre for Language Evolution. My research project focuses on the reference production among bilingual speakers to explore the phenomenon of referential over-explicitness observed in bilingual speakers and the underlying mechanisms that motivate this behavior from cognitive and linguistic perspectives. I am also interested in the role of communication in shaping languages over time within the bilingual communities."
