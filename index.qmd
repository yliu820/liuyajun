Hi, I am a final-year (4th) PhD student in Linguistics at the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences (PPLS), the University of Edinburgh. I am supervised by <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/kenny-smith" target="_blank">Professor Kenny Smith</a> and <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/antonella-sorace" target="_blank">Professor Antonella Sorace</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://cle.ppls.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Centre for Language Evolution</a>. My research project focuses on the phenomenon of referential over-explicitness in the native language of late bilinguals undergoing first language attrition, specifically among speakers of L1 Chinese with L2 English and L1 Chinese with L2/L3 Italian or Spanish. I also explore the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon from both linguistic and cognitive perspectives. Additionally, I am interested in the role of communication in shaping languages over time within the bilingual communities.
